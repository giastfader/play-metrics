### Add @Metered to your controllers
You can either put it on your Controller class, thus enabling it for all controller methods in that class
or on the individual methods you wish to Time.
```java
@org.zapodot.metrics.Timed
@org.zapodot.metrics.Metered
public static Result index() {
    return ok(index.render("Your new application is ready."));
}
```

Add the following to your `routes` file to expose a JSON view of the metrics gathered by this plugin
```
GET     /metrics/timers             org.zapodot.controllers.metrics.MetricsController.timers()

GET     /metrics/meters             org.zapodot.controllers.metrics.MetricsController.meters()

GET     /metrics/counters           org.zapodot.controllers.metrics.MetricsController.counters()
